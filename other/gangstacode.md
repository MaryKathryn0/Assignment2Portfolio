#“Gangsta’s Paradise”

##Verse 1: *Codio*

As I *scroll* through the valley of these *google search results*
I take a look at my *js file* and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been *copyin'* and *pastin'* so long, that
Even my *tutor* thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never *commented* *a line* that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a *float*, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you *debugging*' and where you *console loggin'*
Or you and your *variables* might end up in *lined in //*
I really hate to trip, but I gotta *commit*
As they *rightclick inspect*, I see myself in the *syntax* smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my *VSCode* in the night, *writin' for-Loops* in the streetlight.

##Hook: LV
Been spending most their lives, living in the coda's paradise
Been spending most their lives, living in the coda's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the coda's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the coda's paradise

##Verse 2: Codio
Look at the *function* they got me facin'
I can't do the *mySQL databases*, I was raised by the *jQuery* streets
So I gotta be down with the *node* team
Too much *stackOverFlow* got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with *CSS* on my mind
Got my *integrated terminal open* and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta *npm installin'* banger
And my *arrays* are down so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothing but a *callback* away,
I'm living life, *documentation unread,* what can I say
I'm at 23 *repos* now, but will I live to see 24
The way things are *rendering* I don't know

##Bridge
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me

##Verse 3: *Codio*
Power and the *.JSON*, *.JSON* and the power
*Package* after *Package*, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the *Schema*, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta *import Wizard*, but my *table isn't workin*
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my *database* out of luck, fool!
